  <h2> About Us </h2> 
  
  <p> Established in 1996, Australian Design Architects believe contemporary Australian architecture should capture the spirit and culture of our land. We believe homes should provide a refuge from the world outside and that workplaces should have the ability to inspire. The buildings we create are sustainable, finely crafted in durable materials and highly valued by our clients and the community, enabling them to serve with integrity for generations. </p>
  
  <p> Our role is to understand our clients, allowing you to realise your vision. We create homes that reflect and celebrate your personalities while nurturing you and your families. We believe contemporary Australian residential design, whether house or apartment, should be sophisticated and relaxed, able to delight the senses. It should respect its climate, sheltering you from the sun in summer and from the cold in winter. </p>
  
  <p> When you first encounter our homes, you will be struck by how tall and strong they stand in the street. Once inside, we respect the importance of creating both a public personality – formal living rooms and studies leading off entrances – and a private sanctuary within. Private spaces are hidden behind sliding walls that can be opened to bring formal and informal spaces together when entertaining. </p>
  
  <p> We understand that our architecture sits within a landscape that creates a sense of place, so design urban solutions for urban environments and embrace the wilderness when building in the country. We also believe that landscape, environment and interiors are absolutely one and must be considered as one. </p>
  
  <p> This holistic approach means that when you view our buildings from afar or walk within their gardens you feel uplifted. When you enter them, you experience a luxurious sense of space and light which is the architecture expressing itself. But it is only when you relax in one of our living spaces, among the artwork and furnishings, and view the landscape beyond that you truly understand what we set out to achieve when we craft a home. </p>
